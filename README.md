- 👋 Hi, I’m @danielLucianoMelnyk
- 👀 I’m interested in creating better experiences by reimagining how code is used to enhance design.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (the first two are going great, JavaScript is presenting more challenges. . . wish me luck!)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that I can add value to.
- 📫 You can reach me by email at d.melnyk@rogers.com or find me on linkedin under the name Daniel Melnyk.
